## Project Overview

This project addresses the challenge faced by AtliQ Grands Hotels in maintaining market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel category. By leveraging a dataset of approximately one million rows, a Power BI dashboard was developed to visualize key performance indicators and extract actionable insights. The process involved data cleaning using Power Query, data modeling with a star schema, and the creation of DAX measures to drive the visualizations.

The dashboard focuses on understanding revenue trends, occupancy rates, average daily rate (ADR), RevPAR, and booking patterns across different cities, properties, room categories, and booking platforms. It also incorporates comparative analysis over time to identify emerging trends and potential issues.

## Key Insights

* A recent significant drop in overall revenue is primarily due to a sharp decline in booking numbers across all segments.
* There's an opportunity to implement dynamic pricing strategies to optimize revenue based on weekday and weekend demand.
* Delhi exhibits the highest occupancy but lower revenue due to capacity constraints, suggesting potential for expansion.
* Bangalore shows the lowest occupancy and rating, indicating a need to address customer satisfaction issues at specific hotels.
* A substantial portion of bookings originates from 'Other' platforms, warranting further investigation for targeted marketing.
* A high cancellation rate presents a significant area for potential revenue improvement.
* AtliQ Season requires urgent attention due to its low rating and occupancy.

## Conclusion

This Power BI dashboard serves as a valuable tool for AtliQ Grands to proactively monitor performance, identify critical issues, and gain a deeper understanding of their operational data. The insights derived can inform strategic decisions aimed at regaining market share, optimizing revenue, and improving overall efficiency for sustained growth.
